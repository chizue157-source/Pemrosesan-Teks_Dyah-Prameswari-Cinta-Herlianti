Wesley Jeffers,"i had an account for nearly a decade. I cancelled in July 2024 because they kept increasing their prices and it got to be too expensive for me. I tried logging in today and my email couldn't be found. It took me forever to find their chat, they took a long time to comprehend what I was saying, and it turns out they delete your account permanently after 10 months of inactivity. A decade of my watch history and watchlist gone without warning, no email, no notice. I won't be making a new one.",1,10/11/2025 23:09

Julia,"We have had a full subscription for over 10 years. App now regularly tells us our devices are not part of our household because they are not connected to the household WiFi....even though our devices ARE connected to the home WiFi and no other WiFi. This makes NO SENSE. Honestly, watching films was easier when you went to a store and rented a physical copy. You knew in advance how much time it would take and usually the only problem would be that they didn't have any available copies left.",1,10/11/2025 22:29

I had to use incognito mode just to bypass the redirect and access proper controls. It's absurdly convoluted for something so basic. Parents need clear, direct access—not a maze of restrictions and redirects.",1,10/11/2025 21:30

It's ridiculous and the clearest scam I've ever seen to get a customer to pay X2 the amount I am currently paying, just to get zero ads and access to all films and series.

Also wish there were more shows I could watch with the kids without them being actual kid shows, way too much TV-MA.

Jonathan L.,"No one else has our household's Netflix password, yet this app has decided to not work because I'm not at home. I now need to sign in constantly on this device. If you're thinking about getting Netflix, don't. If you have some way to watch their programming in a less legitimate way, do it. Customer service just said I needed to sign on my home's WiFi and stream a few minutes to avoid this. Lie. It doesn't work. I don't share my account, I don't pirate, I get punished for it.

I do not put money in that account so therefore there isn't funds but now have -R148 due to Netflix trying everyday. The bank says call Netflix as they cannot reverse and Netflix says call the bank as they cannot find the account of bank details. How can they not as they debit everyday.

It shocks me how after many years people have been paying what I think was worth it, now they're just greedy and don't care about their customers. I don't see why we should be making people rich when we're already struggling and they couldn't care less about us. It's a shame.
